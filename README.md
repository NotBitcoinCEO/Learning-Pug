# Overview

I'm working on an addon for a website that I currently run. This is a model of the social app I plan to create.

Social A-Music, or SAM, is a Social music app that will be availale on AtlasMusic.org. I used this original software from CodePen.io and forked off of the original to customize my own layout for SAM. Each bubble will be a friend with the song they have currently chosen to share (or what they're listening to live). Only friend's will be able to DM. Each acount will be connected via crypto wallet, and will allow for the sharing of social tokens between friends that give value for sharing a song that is being listened to more, and lose value depending on how many are listening to it in order to give value to individual artists and original shares.

I wrote this app because I feel inspired to do so. Here's a quick video explaining my thought-process:

# Development Environment

I used Pug for the first time in Visual Studio. It's a way to write divs much quicker.

Pug was something I was confused about when I first saw it on CodePen.io so I decided to look into it and try it out!

# Future Work

* Need to add wallets for each user and create the ability for users.
* Create a roadmap on how to connect each user with other users based on preference.
* Seek algorithm that connects music tastes with others.
